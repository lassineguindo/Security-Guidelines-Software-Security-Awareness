# Security-Guidelines-Software-Security-Awareness

## Project Overview
This project consists of two key components:
1. **Security Guidelines Document** ‚Äì A comprehensive set of best practices for securing an organization‚Äôs data, covering password security, access control, encryption, and patch management.
2. **Software Security Flyer** ‚Äì A visual guide explaining software security threats and best practices to protect systems from cyber threats.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Security Guidelines Document**
This document provides essential security measures for employees and IT teams to enhance cybersecurity in an organization.

### üìå **General Security Guidelines (For All Employees)**
- **Password Security**: Use **strong, unique passwords** and enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- **Email Security**: Be aware of **phishing emails** and verify suspicious senders.
- **Device Security**: Keep devices updated, **install antivirus**, and lock screens when unattended.
- **Data Protection**: Store sensitive data in **approved encrypted locations** and avoid personal email or messaging apps for company data.
- **Incident Reporting**: Report security incidents **immediately** to IT support.

### üîê **Technical Security Guidelines (For IT & Developers)**
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Prevent vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
- **Vulnerability Testing**: Use **OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and penetration tests** for security analysis.
- **Patch Management**: Keep systems updated and **automate patch deployments**.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt **databases, backups, and sensitive transmissions** with **AES-256**.

### üåç **Remote Work Security**
- **Securing Home Networks**: Enable **WPA3 encryption** on routers and use strong Wi-Fi passwords.
- **Using VPNs**: Always use **company-approved VPNs** for remote access.
- **Handling Company Data**: Store work files **only on company-approved cloud platforms**.

üìå **Summary**: Security is a **shared responsibility**‚Äîfollowing these guidelines helps protect **company data, employees, and customers**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Software Security Flyer**
This flyer serves as an **educational tool** to raise awareness about common software security threats and how to mitigate them.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Security Threats**
1. **Phishing Attacks** ‚Äì Fake emails trick employees into sharing sensitive information.
2. **Malware & Ransomware** ‚Äì Malicious software steals or locks data until a ransom is paid.
3. **SQL Injection (SQLi)** ‚Äì Hackers exploit database vulnerabilities to steal company data.
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** ‚Äì Attackers inject malicious scripts into websites.
5. **Weak Passwords** ‚Äì Using simple or reused passwords increases risk.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Best Practices**
- **Use Strong Passwords & MFA**: At least **12 characters**, including **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- **Recognize Phishing Emails**: **Hover over links** before clicking and avoid unknown attachments.
- **Report Security Threats Immediately**: Slow computers, pop-ups, or suspicious emails should be reported to **IT security**.
- **Secure Coding Practices for Developers**: Validate input, sanitize data, and **implement proper error handling**.
- **Regular Vulnerability Assessments**: Conduct penetration testing and **keep software updated**.
- **Data Encryption**: Secure **data at rest and in transit** using strong encryption.

üìå **Summary**: Software security is essential for protecting **company data, customer information, and financial assets**.
